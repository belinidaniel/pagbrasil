Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

I regret to inform you that PagBrasil's risk department has declined our request for opening a merchant account for <XXXXXX>. Our risk department seldom makes transparent the details of their decisions, but I can say it is mainly because they could not make the connection between the products and the potential of the Brazilian market in this sector. 

We are therefore unable to offer you our services.

I would however like to wish you every success with your future endeavours.

Thank you for your understanding.
