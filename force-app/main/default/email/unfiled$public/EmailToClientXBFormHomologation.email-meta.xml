Dear  {!Contact.FirstName},



We hope this message finds you well.
We are pleased to inform you that all parties have fully signed the Agreement. All legal procedures have been addressed, with only one operational step remaining: the Homologation procedure.




You can access this link to complete the checklist. This may involve adjustments to your website and confirming the activation of optional features.


Once the account is homologated, we will be ready to go live and start processing payments: !



For any questions or issues during this process, please rely on your Account Manager for prompt assistance.



We look forward to welcoming you aboard.
