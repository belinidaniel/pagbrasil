<br />
I see a lot of potential for {{{Recipient.Company}}} to increase its market share in Brazil, given its relevance within the software as a service segment.<br />
<br />
That said, for Brazilians, not having the option to pay using Pix or Boleto is a big obstacle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PagBrasil’s PagStream allows you to charge your Brazilian customers in a recurring manner while allowing them to pay using Pix and Boleto, as well as set customized subscription rules.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, our solution does not require any programming, allowing you to easily create and manage your subscriptions directly from PagBrasil´s dashboard.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can we connect to talk about {{{Recipient.Company}}}’s payment operations for Brazil?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
