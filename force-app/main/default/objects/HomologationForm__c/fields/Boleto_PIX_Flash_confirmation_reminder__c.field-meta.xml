    <description>It is mandatory to send email confirmation to your end customer with the generated Boleto URL/PIX code once an order is placed. Emails should always include the Boleto URL/PIX code. This procedure is extremely important to increase your payment conversions.
PagBrasil offers both services with customizable features on behalf of your company. The order confirmation email/SMS is sent when a Boleto/PIX is generated, and the reminder email/SMS is sent two days before the Boleto’s/PIX’s expiration date.
Notifications should be sent at two different moments:
a) Order confirmation: when the order is created, and the Boleto/PIX is generated
b) Due date reminder: 1 or 2 days before the Boleto/PIX due date.</description>
